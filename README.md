# Sovereign MMORPG Engine - 2.5D Multiplayer RPG Engine

[Website](https://sovereignengine.com) | [Documentation (v0.6.0)](https://docs.sovereignengine.com) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mg2jUmePyx)

Sovereign Engine is a 2.5D MMORPG engine with the 2D graphical style of classic RPGs
together with a 3D voxel-based world. The world is highly dynamic and allows
developers and players alike the ability to build homes, mine for resources, farm the
land, and delve into dungeons. Currently in early development, Sovereign will make it easy to
create and share multiplayer RPGs.

Sovereign is developed in C#, runs on Windows and Linux, and is easy to
extend through its distributed Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework.
It also provides a Lua 5.4 scripting engine integrated with the server for
easy extensibility through server-side scripting.

Sovereign Engine is made available under the GPLv3 license.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sovereign Engine is in a pre-alpha state and is not ready for production use.
> The below instructions are provided for users who are interested in trying out the
> current features or using the engine as a starting point for their own development.

### Windows

Download and run the Windows installer for the latest release.

### Linux

Use your distribution's package manager to install the required dependencies:
* libSDL2
* libSDL2_image
* liblua5.4

Download the binary .tar.gz files for the latest release and extract them to the location
where you would like the client and server to be installed.

## Building from Source

Sovereign Engine requires the .NET 9 (or later) SDK to be installed on your system. Clone This
Git repository, then build the `src/Sovereign.sln` solution from your favorite IDE or from
the command line (via `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish`).

## Running the Engine

### Server

On Windows, double-click the `Sovereign.Server.exe` file to launch the server. On Linux, run the
`Sovereign.Server` executable from a shell. This will automatically create a new SQLite database 
at `Data/sovereign.db` if one does not already exist.

The server is configured by default to grant the Admin role to all new players. Once you have created
an initial player with Admin role, it is strongly recommended to disable this option by editing
the server's `appsettings.json` and changing `AdminByDefault` to `false`.

### Client

On Windows, double-click the `Sovereign.Client.exe` file to launch the client. On Linux, run the
`Sovereign.Client` executable from a shell or a desktop launcher. Click "Yes" on the auto-update
prompt to download the latest game data files.
