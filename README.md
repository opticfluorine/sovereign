# Sovereign Engine - Dynamic World MMORPG Engine

Sovereign Engine is an experimental 2D MMORPG engine with a 3D voxel-based
world. The goal is to render a dynamic 3D world with graphics reminiscent of
classic 2D RPGs. Representing the world as a 3D grid of voxels allows the
state of the world to be fully mutable, allowing for open-ended gameplay
and player-created/player-driven worlds.

The engine is currently in a very early stage of development and is a
work in progress. I'm developing this as a hobby in my limited personal time,
so progress can be somewhat slow (but typically steady). The engine is not
feature complete and should be considered as being in a pre-alpha state.
