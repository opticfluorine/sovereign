*** Networking (Issue #8)

**** DONE Accept new event bus connections if login was successful.
     CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The client will pass a shared login token (not the shared secret) when it
attempts connection to the server. Requirements:

***** DONE Requirement: Event Bus Connection Login Token Match
      CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The server shall reject a new event bus connection if the login token is not 
found in the list of valid login tokens.

***** DONE Requirement: Event Bus Connection Login Token Timeout
      CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The server shall reject a new event bus connection if the login token matches 
a token in the list of valid login tokens that is older than
ServerConfiguration.Accounts.HandoffPeriodSeconds.

***** DONE Requirement: Event Bus Connection IP Check
      CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The server shall reject a new event bus connection if the connection does not
originate from the same IP address as the successful login attempt that
resulted in the generation of the login token.

***** DONE Requirement: Accept New Event Bus Connection
      CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The server shall accept a new event bus connection if the login token matches
a token in the list of valid login tokens and the connection attempt does
not violate any of the above requirements.

***** DONE Requirement: Event Bus Connection Login Token Purge
      CLOSED: [2019-10-06 Sun 19:53]
The server shall remove the login token from the list of valid login tokens
upon the successful establishment of a new event bus connection.

**** TODO Automatically connect client to server on startup.
Client login user interface is out of scope for this issue, but it's interesting
so let's give it a shot.

***** TODO Integrate Dear ImGui into client.
A new rendering stage is needed to render the GUI. This should be a two-stage
process following the existing rendering code. First a renderer-independent
stage is invoked, where the required ImGui calls are made and the buffers are
generated. Second the buffers are passed to the renderer, and the appropriate
graphics API calls are made to perform the GUI rendering.

****** TODO Merge ImGui texture atlas into global texture atlas.
Eventually we will want to render sprites from the global texture atlas within
ImGui controls (e.g. for an inventory window). Merging the ImGui texture atlas
into the global texture atlas will eliminate the need for extra texture
binding steps that are slow.

***** TODO Define client state machine.
The client needs to operate as a state machine that determines how the renderer
and input systems behave. Currently this needs a Main Menu state and an In Game
state. A mechanism is needed to facilitate the transition between states.

Eventually a third state, Character Selection, will be added between these two
states. This is beyond current scope.

***** TODO Create login dialog in Main Menu state.
The client shall be able to display a modal login daialog box while in the
Main Menu state.

***** TODO Attempt login through login dialog in Main Menu state.
The client shall attempt login when the user clicks the Login button on the
login dialog.

***** TODO Display login errors to user in a dialog box.
The client shall display login errors in a modal dialog box until the user 
clicks OK.

***** TODO Transition to In Game state upon successful login.
The client shall automatically transition to the In Game state upon a successful
login.

**** TODO Add additional logging to registration and login events.
Not all cases are logged correctly right now. Fix this.
