# Sovereign Engine

Sovereign Engine is a 2.5D MMORPG engine combining the 2D graphical style of classic RPGs together with 
a 3D voxel-based world. The world is highly dynamic and allows developers and players alike the ability 
to build homes, mine for resources, farm the land, and delve into dungeons. Currently in early development, 
Sovereign will make it easy to create and share multiplayer RPGs.

Sovereign is developed in C#, runs on Windows and Linux, and is easy to extend through its distributed 
Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework.

Sovereign Engine is made available under the GPLv3 license.
